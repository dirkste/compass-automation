# Compass Automation - Session Starter

## Project Goal
Automate end-to-end Preventive Maintenance (PM) Work Item workflows in Compass Mobile PWA.

## Tech Stack
- Python 3.13, Selenium, pytest
- Microsoft Edge + WebDriver

## Current State
- ✅ Login + MVA validation stable
- ✅ Open PM Work Items detected and completed
- ✅ Recent PM Work Items skipped (<30 days)
- 🚧 Creating new PM Work Items under test

## How We Work (Chat Reminders)
- Keep responses **concise**
- Default = **FAST MODE** (code-first, diffs preferred)
- Small changes only (≤20 LOC), one commit at a time
- Always suggest new branch before big changes
- Session logs are append-only, History is curated
- Prefer reusing helpers over adding new files

## Next Focus
- Improve reliability of complaint association
- Harden dialog navigation flows
